# Movie recommendation using ALS in Spark

The goal of this project was to use Alternating Least Squares (ALS) in Spark to recommend movies. An ALS model was succesfully created in two stages. Firstly, hyperparameters were tuned using a local implementation of the model with a subset of the training data. Secondly, the final model was trained using all available data using the Google Cloud platform.

## Scope

The scope of the study is restricted to data from [MovieLens](http://movielens.org), a movie recommendation service. It contains 100,836 ratings and 3,683 tag applications across 9,742 movies. The data was generated by 610 users between March 29, 1996 and September 24, 2018. Users were selected at random for inclusion. All selected users have rated at least 20 movies. No demographic information is included.
